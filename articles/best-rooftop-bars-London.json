            "text": "Although it is named after an adjacent road rather than the 90s Australian pop duo, you’ll still fall truly, madly, deeply (apologies…) for the incredible views offered by this classy cocktail bar in the clouds. The slider menu is particularly impressive featuring pork tomahawk, tempura oysters and ‘injectable’ donuts. If you’re looking for a tipple whilst you take in the stunning views of Tower Bridge, then check out the hand-crafted cocktail list and rooftop gin terrace.",

Not satisfied with epic views of London’s skyline or enjoying a great cocktail at the spiritual home of sunset negronis? Frank’s is also part of the Bold Tendencies art gallery, with a cluster of installations to appreciate such as Richard Wentworth’s snaking “Agora” and a variety of other sculptures including new works added for 2020 from Jenny Holzer, Jeremy Deller, Es Devlin, and Fraser T Smith.",

Not a bad way to keep the party going in exile! The rooftop bar offers an excellent cocktail menu as well as a rooftop ice skating rink in the Winter (not particularly linked to the man with the bicorne hat although, who knows, maybe Napoleon enjoyed a rooftop skate from time to time!?).",

The rooftop is open all year round with a tepee donning the roof in colder months. Late night DJ sessions run on the weekend and happy hour £5 cocktails Wednesdays to Fridays 4-7pm keep Londoners always coming back for more!",

Partnering up with Share a Slice, fresh pizzas cooked in traditional Italian woodfired ovens are served alongside cocktails and wine. What’s better is you can feel good about feeling good as, for every pizza purchased, one is donated to feed someone in need!",

Perched atop the 10 stories of the ME building on the Strand, this stylish rooftop venue offers views of the Thames from the Shard down to St Paul’s. Views are best enjoyed with champagne in hand (whether that’s for sunset or sunrise – we won’t judge!).",

Roof East brings you batting cages, crazy golf and curling (yes, you heard us right!) all on top of a multi-storey carpark a stone’s through from Stratford tube station. It doesn’t get more “East London rooftop” than this delightful adult’s playground!",
