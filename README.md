//places.csv / google api task
step1
firstly in places.csv i have added places from the Balham - June 2022.xlsx
step2
After that i am mapping places table and googleData table,in which i am filtering those placeId which are not present in googleDataTable.(nPGoogleData)
step3
Next i am calling GoogleApi for those nPGoogleData.places and saving them into the googledatatable.

I am sending you places.csv of those file record which are added from Balham - June 2022.xlsx.

Note->
In REFINED clapham_2_readable - October 2021.xlsx data we have no id or placeId so am not able to map the records.
